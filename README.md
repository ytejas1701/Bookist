# Bookist: Full Stack App with PostgreSQL as Backend
## A web application for keeping a bucket list of books to be read
Users can add books to their reading list as well as mark them read.Â A Search Box has been implemented using SQL queries, through which users can search for books in the database.

I developed the backend with ExpressJS, using PostgreSQL for persistence of data. I implemented a search box in the app, which utilizes SQL queries and regular expressions for querying through the database. For authorization, I used JSON Web Tokens. I designed the user interface myself, where I gave the components a translucent background, which made the app look clean and modern. I developed the frontend with ReactJS. I also used React-redux and React-router libraries.
